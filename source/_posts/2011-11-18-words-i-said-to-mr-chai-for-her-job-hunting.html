<p>과장님, my Korean is not good enough to explain this. But could you spare me a minute by reading this regarding Dong’s job hunting.</p>

<p>We are very grateful that you gave us this chance. She gave up her own job in China, flew all the way here to support me. But she and I both know that given her ability in Korean, unless she is exposed to Korean speaking environment, she would never be able to find a satisfied job, that is why Dong really cherish this opportunities.</p>

<p>She keeps do all the research on the bond market in China and south Asia for days. And I can assure you that she is the smartest girl even in China, because the law degree in Peking University is the most difficult one to obtain.</p>

<p>As I can feel, that your concerns might be her Korean ability. Believe me, I am about the same level as her when I enter into Shinhan (6 months of Korean studying), I couldn’t understand what my colleagues said. But I think I cope with it better after 6 months. So please, if you don’t mind, help us in this.</p>
