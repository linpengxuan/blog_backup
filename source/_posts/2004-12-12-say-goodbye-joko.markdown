<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Things are always unexpected. </font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Nice to meet you, Joko said. Me too, I replied with a hand shaking with his. He is the one gonna leave tomorrow for Indonesia, also the one never come back for his graduate degree, which just will cost less than 5 months.</font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Everything got a reason. Though I don’t know and I don’t want to know why, I respect what he chooses to do. People have right to do what they want to, don’t they?</font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For me, what left is no more than sad. He makes fun of me, he tells jokes, he is humor and with an incredible ability of English speaking. That is what I thought of him at first. Then at second, he leaves. Probably never see him again.Why am I so sad? Why to a friend even don’t know his full name.</font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When there is a start, an end is due. The time matters only.</font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font> <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Farewell. My international friend. </font> </div>
