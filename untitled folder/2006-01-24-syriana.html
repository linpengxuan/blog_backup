put, with a cold and beard face, he made some noise out of his mouth.<br />
If anything happens to me or my family, an accident, an accusation,<br />
anything, then first your son will disappear, his body will never be<br />
found. Then your wife. Her body will never be found either. This is<br />
guaranteed. Then, whatever is the most dangerous thing you do in your<br />
life, it might be flying in a small plane, it might be walking to the<br />
bank, you will be killed. Do you understand what I'm saying? I want<br />
you to acknowledge that you do understand so that we're clear and<br />
there won't be any mistakes. In a cruel, cold yet confidence voice,<br />
those lines mirrors an attitude from a CIA agent who has been working<br />
for his country for decades,  yet found out been betrayed by the same<br />
employer. Wrath and anger would not be enough to describe what he<br />
could feel, however, still what he would do later prove him as a<br />
patriot  and man of love, peace and equality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Yes,<br />
those are lines from Syriana, one of triology political movies( I<br />
rated accordingly, includes “the Manchuria's Candidate””The<br />
Fahrenheit 911”), has push this movie into a words-killing episode.<br />
We might be sick of typical Hollywood things, full of explosion,<br />
heroism, one-man-save-the-world things or Tom Cruise. Yet for this<br />
kind, I am sure, by unveiling the mysterious agency, we will be<br />
exposed to a person more than real, a person of vengeance set in an<br />
era, the oil price skyrocketing high. What else can one man ask for<br />
more? Define real and cool before u say there might be one more than<br />
those. Harry Potter, Narnia are fairy tales, this is novel damn<br />
suitable for adults.</font></p>
