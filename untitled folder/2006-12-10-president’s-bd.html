<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!1382" class="bvMsg"><p>Dear President,
</p><p>
 </p><p>I still remember how you celebrate your 60<sup>th</sup> birthday last year, when we sang you songs, when you received all of your greetings from your colleagues, students over the world. Just look how soon one year has passed, and you will celebrate another one tomorrow.
</p><p>
 </p><p>Birthday, from my perspective, is just a day commemorating the day of your birth, however, by celebrating it, we would get a chance to look backward what we have done in past year, and what we would do in the coming one. For your case, the best gift is not this mail, but to see the dream of TLBU is approaching, to know that your students are doing something, and to tell yourself all the effort you made this year is not in futile.
</p><p>
 </p><p>Just some simple words, happy birthday.</p></div></p>
