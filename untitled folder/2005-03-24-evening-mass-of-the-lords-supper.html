<p>It is the anniversaries of the Last Supper. I went to church again.</p>

<p>Jesus said: if I, therefore, the master and teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash one another’s feet. I have given you a model to follow, so that as I have done for you, you should also do.</p>

<p>I am the one, whose feet are washed by the Italian father. </p>

<p>Luck should not be a word using here to describe my feeling, more over, a moral burden I wish to take is bestowed, obligating me engage more in this sacred communities, though I still not really and fully understand and believe in the faith.</p>

<p>Forgive me, father, isn’t it the virtue you want us to follow, be faithful and truthful.</p>

<p>i feel guity everyday. for let the river of time floating away from me.</p>
