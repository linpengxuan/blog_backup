start to worry about my family, of none but their health, after my<br />
reading over an article “Life Changes lead to reduce your chances<br />
of heart attack and stroke”. I don't know whether they have already<br />
realized or not, that their own choices would somehow, decisively set<br />
their own way in future. The same as Chaos Theory, just a little step<br />
makes a gap in ten years, or 20. so why not we just give up the<br />
smoking or have a moderate drinking rather than in an unacceptable<br />
way to spoil your own chips. Otherwise, me, your son have to have<br />
taken a consideration of 29% chance in heart attacking and smoking in<br />
next decade since you are already in your own fifties. And I would<br />
definitely not go to take it as a lottery for no such things in the<br />
world boasts for 29% hitting prizes, the same way implying a 29 out<br />
of 100 person of the same physical conditions would suffer while the<br />
other 79 would not in just 10 years, which would be exponential<br />
increasing at your 70s. Why not I bet one million dollars on my ass<br />
for that would of course happen in future time, say 20 if not 10,<br />
lest you don't wrap yourself off those habits and keep them away from<br />
your touch. My suggestion is either you take off, or you suffer.</span></font></font></font></p>

more attention to your own cholesterol level and blood pressure by a<br />
regular system of seeing doctors, getting rid off smoking, your daily<br />
dietary intaking, and physical practicing as well, which according to<br />
those scientific nerds will result in a as low as 3% of outbreaking.</span></font></font></font></p>

u remember, my father, we could almost share a quick money if you<br />
quit smoking after mom asked me to persuade u to do that for a prize<br />
of the amount in case u quit and I proposed to spit this prize for<br />
compensating your own sacrifice. U didn't. Single thought change the<br />
life, isn't it? Or won't it? We'll see.</span></font></font></font></p></div></p>
