probably you have figured out ,ewuuu, stupid pengxuan, misspelling<br />
dear. Well ,no , that is what I meant to. You are welcome.<br />
you don't know how much we miss u and personally how much i miss u.<br />
always said to myself, i would write u a long letter, taking this as a<br />
consideration, you won't feel so sad when u just get an I know from my<br />
last reply to u, as i am doing redemption now,hahah....<br />
i guess this is a quite cool start, isn't it? don't laugh, i know you<br />
would agree from the bottom of ur heart.hahah....(i laugh again)<br />
i think i am obligated to have u known what happened in France. Yes.<br />
Riots. Hahah....<br />
actually, we did a really good job in dealing with all our problems<br />
including, moving in group, curfew, speaking english, even interacting<br />
with Myungkun(i myself sacrifice my face several times to get kisses<br />
from him, now i know his name is disgusting myungkun).... we have our<br />
friendship enhanced. And this could probably be the first time i feel<br />
the chemistry between brothers and sisters (I mean altogether) in TLBU,<br />
and also manage to understand more about President and his ambition.<br />
Hope u are healthy, and you juniors are good , thanks to me, you know.<br />
And say hello to your family if they still remember<br />
me......ahhahahahahahahahah.. again you are welcome. sincerely, mighty<br />
Pengxuan</p>
