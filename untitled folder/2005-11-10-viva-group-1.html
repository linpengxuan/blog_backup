<p>I would also like to express my<br />
gratitude to all my group members, you are always generous and<br />
supportive to all the other members. With the same feeling as Both<br />
and khieng, I would like to keep this good time into my memory as a<br />
token not for the past but a brand new start. So why not we, you<br />
know, keep doing kitchen things later, we got chef, we got cleaning<br />
team we got supermarket here, why not.</p>
<p>And I hate to say this, but you guys<br />
are sweet.</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I totally agree with Liao Li on your<br />
effort and cooperation to make this field study the best one,<br />
especially for our group 1. Everyone has different specialty, but all<br />
together make the group and the whole field study enjoyable, fruitful<br />
and, more importantly, wonderfull.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Forgive me for not being able to<br />
mention the effort each of you made during the field study (for I am<br />
not very good at praising people :)))  ) I cherish and keep<br />
every of your good things, good characteristics, kindness.... in my<br />
mind and heart rather than speaking them out, but as some of you have<br />
experienced that I would talk something I don't like about you face<br />
to face. Therefore, forgive me for all the mistakes I made, anger I<br />
had, inconvenience I caused... to all of you so far.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Honestly, I was very worried about<br />
joining group 1 at first. The reason is that I am too negatively<br />
serious and sober, cannot provide any fun and happy environment,<br />
do not have a very friendly and good relationship with all of you<br />
(100%). In other words, I have quite different characteristics from<br />
most of you. That's totally my problem. Fortunately, I have learnt a<br />
lot from each of you. Though I cannot change myself totally as what<br />
president mentioned in the meeting (less individualistic or be<br />
examplar), I am very happy to learn from you this time and would be<br />
very very extra grateful for your effort and example to keep changing<br />
me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Enjoy the our TLBU family relationship!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Very Best Regards,</p>
<p><br />

<p>&gt;Dear group 1 members,</p>
<p>&gt;  Finally we came back<br />
and enjoyed our field study together.I was 
</p>
<p>&gt;very happy to be with all of<br />
you.During this one month, I saw that 
</p>
<p>&gt;all of you have many shining<br />
spots.I learned much from you and thank 
</p>
<p>&gt;you for all of your help.Everything<br />
we did was the best,I believe.</p>
<p>&gt;  Thanks for our Tu-co's<br />
contribution and sacrifice,especially the 
</p>
<p>&gt;duck,hehe.Thanks for Khieng and<br />
peiyang's effort to find the right 
</p>
<p>&gt;way every time.Thanks for<br />
pengxuan's carefully taking care of 
</p>
<p>&gt;everybody on the way and the great<br />
cleaning job.Thanks for Both's 
</p>
<p>&gt;kind-hearted taking pictures for<br />
all of us and cutting chicken and 
</p>
<p>&gt;meat,we felt very happy to be with<br />
you.Thanks for Jiani's great 
</p>
<p>&gt;washing dishes with pengxuan and we<br />
enjoyed ur beauty in the 
</p>
<p>&gt;trip.Thanks for Queen's delicious<br />
food cooking and should punish you 
</p>
<p>&gt;for making us all get weight<br />
especially my stomach felt 
</p>
<p>&gt;angry,hehe(joking:) ).Thanks for<br />
tiantian's best serving on the 
</p>
<p>&gt;table and ur computer for me and<br />
Queen.Thanks for qiulin's chinese

<p>&gt;  Finally I suggest all<br />
of us first pick out our individual pictures 
</p>
<p>&gt;keeping by ourselves and collect<br />
all the pictures of the others and 
</p>
<p>&gt;then send them to Both. After Both<br />
received , he can send all to

ourselves.</p>
