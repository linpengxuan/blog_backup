once upon a time, i was a kid. always wonder if there anyone lives upon<br />
the sky. day goes by, it seems to me that of course, no one lives<br />
there, how come. upon the sky is sky above, how can they live without<br />
enough oxygen, water, or earth to stand with.<br /><br />then i gave up this thought, and became a non-believer under the communist system.<br /><br />majority<br />
of chinese people maybe believe more in budhism more than christianity,<br />
fine by me. but the problem to them is they don't go to temple to pay<br />
reverence to their believed god until they got problems or they want<br />
god to help them. again, how come? you don't give, how can you expect<br />
yourself to receive.<br /><br />stupid.<br /><br />not until i came to korea<br />
did i realize a problem, that is why half of the korea people have<br />
believed in jesus and god. as scientific developing, it seems there is<br />
no illusion for us to follow. everything can be explained by science<br />
rather than god, even there is something cannot be explained, nor does<br />
jesus can expain neither.<br /><br />so why.<br /><br />i have PVC course here.<br />
PVC means personal virtue and characters, which, i personally think, is<br />
kind of religion history. we learn the history of Christianity, or<br />
MUSLIM. i know what the eid-al fitr is. i know what is the relationship<br />
between jesus and god. knowing the immaculate conception. know what<br />
baptism is. anyway, i learn a lot that not exist in my world before.<br /><br />i am enlightened.<br /><br />still not knowing why.<br /><br />even<br />
my pvc mid-term exam, asking about how to balance the relation between<br />
the science and supernatural phenomenas. how can i explain that if i<br />
still am a non believer.<br /><br />than comes novels by Don Brown.<br /><br />i<br />
start to realize something moral that exist in Christianity rather than<br />
science. science can heal the disease, can cure the patient, can build<br />
comfortable house, can produce the food we need... science do a lot of<br />
things that help us, but....<br /><br />it still could be evil. the gun, the artilery, not to mention the nuclear bomb.<br /><br />well,<br />
in this situation. we need religion. it is religion that improve our<br />
morality rather than decrease it, maybe they are not real one, but i<br />
have to emphasize that we need them. what it does just like a lamppost<br />
around the corner showing you what is right, what is wrong, kind of law<br />
and regulations in your heart.<br /><br />what if the world without it.<br /><br />i suppose genocide will be spread over the world without any limitation.<br /><br />in this sense, we need religion.<br /><br /><br />today<br />
when i have the law of treaty class. i suddenly ask myself, why not<br />
myself creat a religion that fills all the gap between science and god.<br />
if science says there is no god. fine, then there is no god in my<br />
religion. if i think there is something science need to be aware of,<br />
fine, my religion could offer that. we could be their pollar in their<br />
lifes. we could be the compasses in their voyage. we could be anything.<br /><br />so maybe i will...................................</div></p>
