<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!1108" class="bvMsg">最近更新很少，是因为写得东西少。没东西上传了，就把刚写的DISSERTATION ACKNOWLEDGEMENT放上吧。<br /><br /></div></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">One of the greatest things I learned from TLBU<br />
in the past 2 years is knowing how to be grateful for everything I used to take<br />
granted for. Indeed, from this prospective, the first person I truly and<br />
sincerely respect and express my gratitude to is my President, Dr. LYOU Byunghwa,<br />
for he not only shows me the vastness of his International legal expertise and<br />
knowledge, guiding me into the right track on academic performance, moreover, the<br />
love bestowed on me with a vision as a successful elder.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Also, I wouldn’t forget all the other<br />
faculty members in TLBU, Prof. John Lee, Prof. Choe, Prof. Kim, Prof. Thomas,<br />
and Prof. Hong, I wouldn’t be lead into this legal majestic hall were not for<br />
the help from all of them. Thanks.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">I also am glad to meet a lot more friends here,<br />
thanks to you guys for bringing me laughters and sharing things with me. The end<br />
of June, 2006 marks the time we departed from each other, also starts an era of<br />
lifetime friendships among us.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Last but not the least, thanks to my<br />
beloved parents, for everything you have done to me, and for spoiling me all<br />
the time, for adopting my little sister.</span></p></p>

<p><br /></p>
