<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!493" class="bvMsg"><p><font size="2">Couple days ago, when I<br />
held my birthday party in Pingpong room, I addressed to my juniors,<br />
my classmates and our doctor students, never do I feel so close to<br />
each other as brothers and sisters, never do I realize the gap<br />
between Chinese and non-Chinese group could be narrowed down to an<br />
almost non-existent level after European Field Study. Those are some<br />
extra benefits we gained from the trip, which, thanks to TLBU<br />
multinational education system, also provides us an opportunity to<br />
broad our vision abroad, refine our leadership, increase our regional<br />
cooperation between Asia countries and our European counterparts to a<br />
higher level. Words need no more, but thanks, Mr. President.</font></p></div></p>
