<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!847" class="bvMsg">me and guodong patronized a same pair of shoes. I woke up this morning, thinking about walking back to campus town, and got my shoes. and I found something were different, they were much cleaner. now that must belong to Guodong. when it comes to the whereabout of mine, I need to say no more.<br /><br />his response is yesterday I found out, the feeling is a little bit different.<br /><br /><br /></div></p>
