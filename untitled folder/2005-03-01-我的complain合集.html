Dear Sir or Madam:</div></p>

<p>I subscribe to economist printing edition on 4th Feb, the order number is: 351716. according to the notice, I was suppose to receive my customer reference number and have it added to my account details to transform my 40 days temporary account into a one year long subscription in 28 days.</p>

<p>It is already almost one month; I received no printing edition nor customer reference number at all. If it is because of my failure to give the right mailing address, I want to have it reconfirmed. </p>

<p>My mailing address:  TLBU, 300, Naeyu-dong, Dukyang-ku, Kyunggi-do, Seoul, <br />
412-751, Korea</p>

<p>Otherwise, please let me know if something went wrong.</p>
