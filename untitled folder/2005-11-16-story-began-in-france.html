<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!497" class="bvMsg">Here the story begins<br />
Being there in the middle of Autumn, we found the concern of the<br />
weather could be one of the reasons why we went earlier than the last<br />
year’s schedule. In other words, our schedule fits us, it wasn't<br />
neither too hot nor extreme cold. To our surprise, we didn't use<br />
umbrella or thick jacket a lot during 3 weeks as we were told of<br />
unpredictable climate by our seniors. However, what we haven't foreseen<br />
is have to walk all the time, started and ended in our institute in<br />
Chantily-Gouvieux, from 7 am to 7 pm sometimes, the only time-break was<br />
enjoyed during our lunch time in University Restaurant everyday. I<br />
would be really exaggerate or hypocrite to say we did enjoy everyday.<br />
sometimes the cases would be that we started in the early morning when<br />
it was still dark, come back at 5 or 6, prepared food for the rest of<br />
students and most of all, washed all the dishes till 11 o'clock due to<br />
unexperienced skill. As time flied, those small and tedious things<br />
become part of our lives and we did cherish them. We had problems<br />
dealing with everything, by solving them with Myungkun and other doctor<br />
students, we also became closer friends. Besides, isn't dealing and<br />
solving the problem one of the virtues and characters future leader<br />
should bear?<br />
We, 30 students along with Doctor students and staff Mr. Kim, were<br />
divided into 4 groups, where all non- graduate students were assigned<br />
to group 4. for the first 3 groups, we were responsible for cooking and<br />
cleaning turn by turn, 3 days around. Also, a voting system was<br />
introduced to increase the competition aiming at a higher quality of<br />
service, it worked as quoted from some economic textbook,”competitions<br />
are good, competitions observe the rules in market”. By doing so, all<br />
the dinner seemed to be more diversified as coming to the end of the<br />
field study under the guide of all the chefs and cooks in 3 groups, an<br />
indication of fiercer competition among one another, although with a<br />
shortage of food supplied when we were informed of the avian flu<br />
sporadically found in European Continent, which cut the chicken off the<br />
list, and a not-too-much budget over dinner. We were proud of this, for<br />
one thing, we could have more, second, more cooperation among us with<br />
an understanding for each other, thus resulted in strengthening the<br />
friendship, as I mentioned in acknowledgment.</div></p>
