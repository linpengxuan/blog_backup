<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!1078" class="bvMsg">think about it. when everyone round us is busying making money or thinking how to make money. the place where we have lived on for centuries is no longer what we perceived before. I overheard some saying, ten ever hottest year in human's history ever record is the last ten years with 2005 its peak. what are we going to do to save oursleves and our's generation if we are not that selfish. a moment at stake could hardly be more elusive. it is up to you, or up to me?!<br /><br />It is only take you a little bit effort to protect our Earth, and ourself. <br /><br /><div style="width:502px;"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/56/133327942_b3f6db5f37.jpg?v=0" alt="" height="326" width="500" /><br /><br /><div style="width:502px;"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/44/133327932_71238ca02d.jpg?v=0" alt="" height="325" width="500" /><br /><br />a not too bad movie was presented to you. <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount_classics/aninconvenienttruth/trailer/">an incovinient truth</a>.<br /><br />also another documentary movies shows how cheap democracy was when it confronts the superpower: a road to guantanamo. and show us things actually and always are not what we think used to be.<br /><br /><div><img src="http://www.channel4.com/film/newsfeatures/microsites/G/guantanamo/images/main.jpg" alt="The Road To Guantanamo" border="0" width="414" /><br /><br />you might think him is regretting, confessing. but it is not. take a look at this movie, it won't take you long, it will make you reconsider the power of muslim. shudder you at the first thought.<br /></div><br /></div><br /></div><br /></div></p>
