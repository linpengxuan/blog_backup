1. it doesn't matter what you want to do, it matters when. do it now.<br />
2. an art of knowing what and how to give up.<br />
<br />
for those of you really have a lot more time than I do, you can read<br />
it. be aware, this is none but an american antelope, jump, jump without<br />
nexus.<br />
<br />
when it comes to me that I am not busy, which, unfortunetely is the<br />
case for me all the time, I start to think about why people keep trying<br />
to gain something, something and something more. this way left me no<br />
result, for I am not a philosopher. but some would say that is meaning<br />
of life. shit. what is life?<br />
<br />
life is nothing but a box of chocalate, u never know what it would<br />
taste next, but there is at least something we can do by looking the<br />
shape or the wrapper of the chocalate, we will know it would probably<br />
made of peanuts or chusnuts than it otherwise could be. I take that as<br />
the initialtive.<br />
<br />
apparently, I am a person happen to be good at preaching something. I<br />
could easily find a way how to solve the issue. the problem is that, I<br />
am just way too lazy, or afraid of changing, that results in a lacking<br />
of initiative. I means, sometimes what I need to do is take the first<br />
step, then 2nd, then 3rd... one by one till the end and voila, job is<br />
done, and usually I would convince myself time and time again, since I<br />
already get the knowhow, do I need to. No is a preferable answer,<br />
always.<br />
<br />
retrospecting most leaders, they don't deal with disputes same way as I<br />
do, they convince not only them but the persons around them, and they<br />
do, and do them gung-ho.<br />
<br />
ok, here comes to my first conclusion, rule 1 to make you're 1st million bucks is<span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"> it doesn't matter what you want to do, it matters when. do it now.</span><br />
<br />
one of my very best friends, or, Miss Barbie according to her own<br />
words, asked me not to push myself too hard. I didn't, I just cried for<br />
my own mirage, something not impossible but diffcult. he who has more<br />
choices has no choices. I am him. <br />
<br />
frankly, I don't have a clear roadmap. sometimes I would do this,<br />
sometimes I prefer to others. I just can't dig something out, the way I<br />
invest my time is problematic if not crazy.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">rule No. 2, give up something before you set out for your targets.</span><br />
