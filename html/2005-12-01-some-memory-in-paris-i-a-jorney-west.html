was already 26 hrs since we left Seoul last time.  A journey of<br />
virgin, I suppose this trip would be. And certainly it was. The first<br />
stop is Hong Kong. My dream place, which I have thought about<br />
visiting couple times. Time is limited, even me I don't have enough<br />
time to set up my wireless network in the airport.</span></font></font></font></p>

Hong Kong Stop</span></font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2">It<br />
is only the modernized constructions and the Cantonese-English mixing<br />
speaking environment make me realize this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> last<br />
land China reclaimed from its colonies, and which still keeps its own<br />
distances from the owner. Everything was not quite strange to me,  <br />
for I know this is typical airport, only with a knowledge that this<br />
airport seems to be rated as the most human friendly airport over the<br />
earth, apart from this, I know nothing about here as I do to Hong<br />
Kong, not to mention the newly open Disneyland. What amazed, which I<br />
should not used is the Internet from wireless network is free. I<br />
regretted my short staying there, for I got chance to stay so close<br />
with the eastern pearl but with a not-enough time. Packing all my<br />
stuff along with unbagged slippers is the things I finished in 15<br />
seconds for I was informed to get on board.</font></font></p>

<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">I<br />
hate to admit I am a person of missy, but indeed I am. You will know<br />
by telling from the diaries I made.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">1,<br />
I enjoyed a business class with an economic ticket. It was a little<br />
things you can embrace only with some braveness and losing face. I<br />
sat on the first row of my cartage. For I know I can't stuck on this<br />
small room for 12 hrs. come on, that disastrous memory I took in my<br />
first bachlor year backing home reminded me again. Cool, and I did<br />
it, took a seat which by then not been taken yet. With no luck, I had<br />
to surrender it later when the seat holder came to me. Damn it, I<br />
told myself in my heart. Then I moved to another seat in the first<br />
row.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">2,<br />
time-killing. First, I made a question to a fly attendant, who I<br />
thought was beautiful and mature about the electric plug. Her<br />
positive answer surprised me for I didn't really expect to hear a<br />
yes. Not until I found the plug needed a transfer did it make me sad.<br />
Damn it, again. She told me I could buy a tax-free transfer plug. I<br />
made my own move, good, why not, then I could play with my computer<br />
all the time from then on with a psychiatric price of 10 dollar. I<br />
knew I was gonna say damn it again, for it was priced 116 dollar.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Please,<br />
lend me one.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Ok,<br />
I will ask someone if he agreed. This attendant from Cathay Airline<br />
indeed did not fail me.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">We<br />
charge you 5 dollars an hour.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Damn<br />
it, tell me that was a joke. I was almost come out with this sentence<br />
were he not someone strange to me. And he is making a joke and I felt<br />
shamed for not catching that.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">3,<br />
she is nice. For whatever reason I don't want to believe, say, that<br />
is her job, she was trained to do this. Rather I would like to<br />
believe that was just because of me. Like the good old days when I<br />
was in ECUPL, I chose to believe all the girls' apple in their eyes<br />
is me, ridiculous but felt good.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">She<br />
is beautiful.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">She<br />
is mature enough,*******************(del 6 words here), I suppose.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">I<br />
did not thank her directly for I got no chance. I will pray for her.<br />
May god bless her and beautify her more.</span></font></font></font></p>

<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">tiredness<br />
is not the first thing we felt after a 12 hr long journey in a plane<br />
full of non-stopping and quite disturbing noise. It was all just<br />
because it was Paris. Don't mention the Taxi are from Mercedes Benz<br />
or Volkswagen. I am a self-lover that could even love me more by<br />
receiving a smile from the custom lady.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Eiffle<br />
tower and other places as planned to visit did not really recall my<br />
attention too much, rather it was those distinguish and unique style<br />
of France streets and well-dress French or foreigners raise my<br />
appetite to know this country more. I will write more about this<br />
later.</span></font></font></font></p>
<p lang=""><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Our<br />
institute locates in a place near Paris, not quite much known to<br />
visitors but worthy traveling. I guess that is something we should<br />
proud of, isn't it?</span></font></font></font></p>
