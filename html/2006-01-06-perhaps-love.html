<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!795" class="bvMsg"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">It<br />
should be most dulling movie I ever seen before moving into a theater<br />
and taking a look at it by accident when my desiring one is Narnia,<br />
or even after watched the first stage  when a stupid Korean guy<br />
jumped out of a 70s' bus and began to dance and sing that  moment<br />
forced a shit coming out of my mouth, another night was ruined. And<br />
it turned out to prove me wrong again by my ending at tears.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The<br />
story was simple from a literature way, the story of past, presence<br />
and in the movie. A girl fooled around in Beijing the end of 80s, a<br />
time western culture holding a conflict controversial dispute with<br />
Confusion in China. She tried all her means to make herself famous<br />
including her body till she made it during which she, incredibly,<br />
fell in love with a Hong Kong student who was learning movie art<br />
then, truly and faithfully. Two faces of young girl made her lost and<br />
disdain herself that resulted in leaving him, which was<br />
unquestionable and foreseeable. However, where one's imagination<br />
goes, where the movie could end. The two Chinese met at last, famous<br />
but with indifferent faces to everything including themselves or far<br />
and soon between.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">And<br />
I always treated art is a way by translating simplicity into complex<br />
ones, the more un-understandable, the more successful it could be or<br />
we might say, it could be regarded. Same rule applies here. The<br />
director is a good one, especially has a right for final cut. I was<br />
living in wonderland without knowing where I was at the begging of<br />
the 30 mins. What the hell is he trying to talk about by inserting<br />
the past, presence one by another, as if you were swimming in<br />
tropical area at one time, the next you would have been exposed in<br />
the Antarctica watching those polar bears, naked. Damn it!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">But<br />
I wouldn't regard it fail. It is good one, two thumbs up. And you<br />
were shown it in Korea that a good sign to know the movie industry in<br />
China is reviving, given the fact another Chinese one also became a<br />
blockbuster here. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The<br />
story could never happen on us, we regular people, but deserve us to<br />
fade the feeling inside. Perhaps Love, one you should, perhaps sip.</font></p><br /><br /><img src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c330/pennyg/micellaneous/perhapslove.jpg" alt="Image hosted by Photobucket.com" /></div></p>
