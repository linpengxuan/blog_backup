begin today's blog, let me ask you a question. Could you please tell<br />
me what you would feel at your 60<sup>th</sup> birthday? eh... hard<br />
to say. Yeah, that is a good thing about being a human, one could<br />
never know what happens next? No one would disagree about we do our<br />
jobs, so does God. Then let us focus on the job we could do. At 60,<br />
some would retire, some still work, some in jail I suppose, or die in<br />
traffic accidents, I don't know. The thing I am sure about is, some<br />
won't have a chance to celebrate their birthdays as Our President,<br />
who is able to send invitations as many as 2000,  enjoys the remarks<br />
from his 90-year-old tutor,  or takes greeting from his students<br />
across Asia. Some had said, President lives in a big dream, I agree,<br />
but his dream will finalize because of his own will, strong<br />
determination and broad vision.</font></p>
<p style="font-family:Garamond,Times,Serif,Simsun;"><font size="3">60<br />
years is a circle of life. Now with a newly freshed life, President<br />
marches on. </font>
