<p><p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Some<br />
asked me about why I keep jogging all the time. It isn't funny at<br />
all, that you have to endure all the boring site views and risk your<br />
life in high times. I see the other way. Professor Choe said people<br />
are greedy and greedy is good. I can feel it when I am doing my<br />
jogging. I see no reason to deny I am a person not satisfied just<br />
with what I can do now, I want to see bigger picture and I want to<br />
experience higher competition. This also applies to the way I jog.<br />
When I can run up to 12 mins, I felt so tired and exhausted, but<br />
thanks to god, I still can finish it. Then why not try 24 mins. After<br />
that, why not 36 mins, and till now 50 mins in 1 year. The good thing<br />
about this that I can feel instantly is my heartbeat rate lower to 60<br />
per min sometimes(just sometimes). I am approaching my one of my many<br />
dreams, finish a marathon in one's life time, which I haven't got any<br />
gut to think about that a year ago, yet it is coming into reality<br />
after I sighed up into one of biggest marathon in Seoul next month,<br />
only half course. However, it is this little step that restores or<br />
more accurately, build up my own confidence. I wouldn't deny anything<br />
about this, yes, I will run marathon and till the last minute in the<br />
world that I can tell myself, that I have archived something most<br />
people on earth can't ever think about.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">But<br />
this is not the overwhelming reason for jogging. I prefer call the<br />
most important one, the beauty of last kilometer. I do feel exhausted<br />
all the time, but in no case had I ever stopped on the way just<br />
because of that, because I kept telling myself, u stop, u stop<br />
forever, there is no alternative for not keeping on. The joyful<br />
moment, the prize of this always comes in the last kilometer. When<br />
you know you can and will finish this in less than 4 minutes, you<br />
will start to feel the beauty of last kilometer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">That<br />
is exactly came to me this morning. 15 kilometers in 52 mins, not<br />
bad. Last moment I saw the sun's rising, shining on my body for I<br />
wasn't feeling chilly anymore, the road become golden not the usual<br />
dusty and dull, the wind blows whistling around your ears, as if you<br />
got a sixth sense only can by touched at that moment.</font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">I<br />
will strive on even in risk of my legs......</font></p></p>
