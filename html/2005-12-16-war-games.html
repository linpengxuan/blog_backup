<p><font face="Tahoma">Oct 13th 2005</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">From The Economist<br />
print edition</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">A big pay-off for<br />
two game theorists </font>
</p>
<p></p><p><font face="Tahoma">THIS year's Nobel<br />
prize for economics might almost have doubled as the prize for peace.<br />
On October 10th, three days after the International Atomic Energy<br />
Agency and its director-general, Mohamed ElBaradei, won their laurels<br />
for monitoring the misuse of nuclear power, the economics prize was<br />
bestowed on two scholars whose best work was also done in the shadow<br />
of the mushroom cloud. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Robert Aumann, of<br />
Hebrew University, and Thomas Schelling, of the University of<br />
Maryland, are both game theorists. Game theory is now part of every<br />
economist's toolkit and has been recognised by the Nobel award<br />
before, when John Harsanyi, John Nash and Reinhard Selten shared the<br />
honour in 1994. It is the study of what happens when the calculating,<br />
self-interested protagonist of economic fable meets another member of<br />
his kind. In such encounters, neither party can decide what to do<br />
without taking into account the actions of the other.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">During the cold<br />
war, two protagonists that captured game theorists' imaginations were<br />
the United States and the Soviet Union. How each of these nuclear<br />
adversaries might successfully deter the other was the most pressing<br />
question hanging over Mr Schelling's classic work, “The Strategy of<br />
Conflict”, published in 1960. The book ranged freely and widely in<br />
search of an answer, finding inspiration in gun duels in the Old<br />
West, a child's game of brinkmanship with its parents, or the safety<br />
precautions of ancient despots, who made a habit of drinking from the<br />
same cup as any rival who might want to poison them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Mr Schelling's<br />
back-of-the-envelope logic reached many striking conclusions that<br />
appeared obvious only after he had made them clear. <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">He argued that a<br />
country's best safeguard against nuclear war was to protect its<br />
weapons, not its people.</span> A country that thinks it can withstand a<br />
nuclear war is more likely to start one. Better to show your enemy<br />
you can hit back after a strike, than to show him you can survive<br />
one. Mr Schelling invested his hopes for peace not in arms reductions<br />
or fall-out shelters but<span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"> in preserving the ability to retaliate</span>, for<br />
example by putting missiles into submarines. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">All-out<br />
thermonuclear warfare is the kind of game you get to play only once.<br />
Other games, however, are replayed again and again. It is these that<br />
fascinate Mr Aumann. In a repeated encounter, one player can always<br />
punish the other for something he did in the past. The prospect of<br />
vengeful retaliation, Mr Aumann showed, opens up many opportunities<br />
for amicable co-operation. One player will collaborate with another<br />
only because he knows that if he is cheated today, he can punish the<br />
cheat tomorrow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Mutually assured<br />
co-operation</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">According to this<br />
view, co-operation need not rely on goodwill, good faith, or an<br />
outside referee. It can emerge out of nothing more than the cold<br />
calculation of self-interest. This is in many ways a hopeful result:<br />
opportunists can hold each other in check. Mr Aumann named this<br />
insight the “folk theorem” (like many folk songs, the theorem has<br />
no original author, though many have embellished it). In 1959, he<br />
generalised it to games between many players, some of whom might gang<br />
up on the rest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Mr Aumann is loyal<br />
to a method—game theory—not to the subject matter of economics<br />
per se. His primary affiliation is to his university's delightfully<br />
named Centre for Rationality, not its economics department. Trained<br />
as a mathematician, he started out as a purist—pursuing maths for<br />
maths' sake—but soon found his work pressed into practical use.<br />
Between 1965 and 1968, for example, he co-wrote a series of reports<br />
for the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The<br />
Russians and Americans were pursuing gradual, step-by-step<br />
disarmament. But the military capabilities of each superpower were so<br />
shrouded in mystery that neither side knew precisely what game they<br />
were playing: they did not know what their opponents were prepared to<br />
sacrifice, nor what they themselves stood to gain. Without knowing<br />
how many missiles the Russians had, for example, the Americans could<br />
not know whether an agreement to scrap 100 of them was meaningful or<br />
not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">In such games, Mr<br />
Aumann pointed out, how a player acts can reveal what he knows. If<br />
Russia were quick to agree to cut 100 missiles, it might suggest its<br />
missile stocks were larger than the Americans had guessed. Or perhaps<br />
the Russians just wanted the Americans to think that. Examples of<br />
such deception are not limited to the cold war. Some have speculated<br />
that Saddam Hussein pursued a similar strategy in the run-up to the<br />
invasion of Iraq in 2003.<span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);"> Despite apparently having no actual weapons<br />
of mass destruction left, he offered only the most grudging<br />
co-operation to weapons inspectors. The Iraqi dictator perhaps wanted<br />
to conceal the humiliating fact that he had nothing much to hide</span>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Messrs Aumann and<br />
Schelling have never worked together, perhaps because the division of<br />
labour between them is so clear. Mr Aumann is happiest proving<br />
theorems; Mr Schelling delights in applying them. Mr Aumann operates<br />
at the highest levels of abstraction, where the air is thin but the<br />
views are panoramic. Mr Schelling tills the lower-lying valleys,<br />
discovering the most fertile fields of application and plucking the<br />
juiciest examples.</font></p>
<p><font face="Tahoma">In one of his more<br />
unusual papers, Mr Aumann uses game theory to shed light on an<br />
obscure passage in the Talmud, which explains how to divide an asset,<br />
such as a fine garment, between competing claimants. <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">You should give<br />
three-quarters to the person who claims all of it, and the remaining<br />
quarter to the person who claims half of it, the text instructs,<br />
somewhat inscrutably</span>. Fortunately, the Nobel committee had no need<br />
for such a complicated rule in dividing up its prize. Between its two<br />
equally deserving laureates, it split the SKr10m ($1.3m) fifty-fifty.
