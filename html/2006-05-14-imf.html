<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!1095" class="bvMsg">Well, this was straight to the point. Finally Hollywood seems to be<br />
over their boring (hoping for Oscar) drama movies. Good old Cruise<br />
returning as Ethan Hunt is what you will see here. Action consisting of<br />
explosions, clever bombs, helicopter chases, flashbacks to True Lies<br />
without spoiling too much, evil villains, heartbreaking stunts and a<br />
pretty okay script is what you can expect.<br /><br />Some predictable scenes, but the fast paced action made the effort<br />
worth it with some very welcome ideas. You also got to love the<br />
scenery. Berlin, Vatikan and China is refreshing to see.<br /><br />007 look out, hard to match this one! <br /><br />Long time since I had such fun at the cinema.<br /><br /><br /><img alt="The image “http://www.c7nema.net/fotos/mi31.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." src="http://www.c7nema.net/fotos/mi31.jpg" /><br /></div></p>
