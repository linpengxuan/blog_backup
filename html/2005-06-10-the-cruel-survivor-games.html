<p>things exactly happen this way recently. i took lsat, expecting for a higher score. with the back of that, i told myself there would be in no way something stuck on my way ahead. just days later, this unrealistic dream was broken by some refusal letters from law firms. i did great in this week's presentation, i did great in contract law class, but neither does them help. now it turns that i am a small frog in a well looking up into a sky only as large as the rim of this well. and that is it!</p>
