<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!831" class="bvMsg"><p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">I<br />
am not good at talking, so when he tried to preach something to me,<br />
the best thing is to keep silent, and pretend all he said was right.<br />
Even though he made it right by an authoritarian way, somehow I still<br />
have an complex to fight against his words yet foresee an<br />
already-known answer, he is not that easily changed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">I<br />
prepared many sounding reasons for him, all of which I can't even<br />
start  a word. It is not that I lost my confidence, but I found, as<br />
usual, all the effort I made, am making would be in vain. In other<br />
words, the struggle is meaningless, whose only result makes him feel<br />
you are not serious enough. Fine. I had better shut up!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">However,<br />
again, he changed my mind. I hate to say that I am the straw blowing<br />
in the wind, but not an eagle there is something for sure. I tried to<br />
explain what I want to be after that, but I found I lost myself in an<br />
empty space, didn't know what to say. Do I really want to take that<br />
position there? Ask myself. The instinct answer would be No! And the<br />
second one if asked again is of course not. Now, he said my favorite<br />
working place is somewhere bigger and I have already lost my<br />
confidence. I did lost my confidence on finding a job especially I<br />
can't arrange an interview with them or get refusal time and time<br />
again. But this confidence is not necessary in need for me, Or this<br />
kind of confidence. What I need is what I have now, so don't worry<br />
about that!</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Don't<br />
make the same mistake twice. So, I guess he is right, a second time!<img src="/rte/emoticons/lightbulb.gif" /><img src="/rte/emoticons/lightbulb.gif" /> </font>
