<p>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will<br />
disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the<br />
earth and everything done in it will be laid bare. Since everything will be<br />
destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to</p>

<p>live holy and godly lives</p>
