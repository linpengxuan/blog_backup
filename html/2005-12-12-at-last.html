day, though cold. They left, some for China, some Pusan, wawo, seems<br />
as if we are the king of the school now, eh, things could not be<br />
better yeah, you are right, party tonight. The first day ever I got<br />
up at 10:50 after saw them off, damn it, feel good. I am lazy, so<br />
nothing is expected to be done during He's absence. Then I get bored.<br />
What can I do to kill time? To kill myself, not bad an idea, and not<br />
now.  I wrapped my ass off the bed, staring in the mirror with my Ray Ban for a long<br />
time, perfect. Satisfied, I figured out why not make it a little bit<br />
more perfect. So today's tip of free is shining your shoes, taking<br />
your one-month-not-washed jeans to laudary. Believe me, my friend,<br />
that is nice.</font></p>
