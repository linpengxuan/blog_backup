<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!1461" class="bvMsg"><br />I was informed your mother's passed away this morning. I am sorry for that.<br /><br />Â As<br />
far as I remembered, I met her once when Yasujeon went into business,<br />
though no communication then, we still could feel what a kind-hearted<br />
and strong women she was. I also know she will ascend to the heaven,<br />
praying for you and TLBU from above as we do here. so please don't be<br />
too sad for this, it is the physical departure that kept us away, not<br />
spiritual...
<br /><br />and I will pray for her next time I go to Mass.</div></p>
