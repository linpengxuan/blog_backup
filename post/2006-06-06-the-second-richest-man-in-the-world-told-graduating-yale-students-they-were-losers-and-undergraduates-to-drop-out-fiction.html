        Subject: Graduation speech<br />
        <br />
 This is true<br />
        <br />
I thought you would get a kick out of this speech that Larry Ellison<br />
(Oracle CEO) gave at Yale University to the Graduating class of 2000.<br />
What follows is a transcript of the speech delivered by Ellison at Yale<br />
University last month:<br />
        <br />
&quot;Graduates of Yale University, I apologize if you have endured this<br />
type of prologue before, but I want you to do something for me. Please,<br />
take a good look around you. Look at the classmate on your left. Look<br />
at the classmate on your right. Now, consider this: five years from<br />
now, 10 years from now, even 30 thirty years from now, odds are the<br />
person on your left is going to be a loser. The person on your right,<br />
meanwhile, will also be a loser. And you, in the middle? What can you<br />
expect? Loser. Loserhood. Loser Cum Laude.<br />
        <br />
In fact, as I look out before me today, I don't see a thousand hopes<br />
for a bright tomorrow. I don't see a thousand future leaders in a<br />
thousand industries. I see a thousand losers. You're upset. That's<br />
understandable.<br />
        <br />
After all, how can I, Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Ellison, college dropout, have<br />
the audacity to spout such heresy to the graduating class of one of the<br />
nation's most prestigious institutions? I'll tell you why. Because I,<br />
Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Ellison, second richest man on the planet, am a<br />
college dropout, and you are not. Because Bill Gates, richest man on<br />
the planet-for now anyway-is a college dropout, and you are not.<br />
Because Paul Allen, the third richest man on the planet, dropped out of<br />
college, and you did not. And for good measure, because Michael Dell,<br />
No. 9 on the list and moving up fast, is a college dropout, and you,<br />
yet again, are not.<br />
        <br />
Hmm ... you're very upset. That's understandable. So let me stroke your<br />
egos for a moment by pointing out, quite sincerely, that your diplomas<br />
were not attained in vain. Most of you, I imagine, have spent four to<br />
five years here, and in many ways what you've learned and endured will<br />
serve you well in the years ahead. You've established good work habits.<br />
You've established a network of people that will help you down the<br />
road. And you've established what will be lifelong relationships with<br />
the word &quot;therapy.&quot; All that of is good. For in truth, you will need<br />
that network. You will need those strong work habits.<br />
        <br />
You will need that therapy. You will need them because you didn't drop<br />
out, and so you will never be among the richest people in the world. Oh<br />
sure, you may, perhaps, work your way up to #10 or #11, like Steve<br />
Ballmer. But then,I don't have to tell you who he really works for, do<br />
I?<br />
        <br />
        And for the record, he dropped out of grad school. Bit of a late bloomer.<br />
        <br />
Finally, I realize that many of you, and hopefully by now most of<br />
you,are wondering, &quot;Is there anything I can do? Is there any hope for<br />
me at all?&quot; Actually, no. It's too late. You've absorbed too much,<br />
think you know too much. You're not 19 anymore. You have a built-in<br />
cap, and I'm not referring to the mortarboards on your heads.<br />
        <br />
        Hmm ... you're really very upset. That's understandable.<br />
        <br />
So perhaps this would be a good time to bring up the silver lining. Not<br />
for you, Class of '00. You are a write-off, so I'll let you slink off<br />
to your pathetic $200,000-a-year jobs, where your checks will be signed<br />
by former classmates who dropped out two years ago.<br />
        <br />
        Instead, I want to give hope to any underclassmen here today. I say to you, and I can't stress this enough:<br />
        <br />
LEAVE. Pack your things and your ideas and don't come back. Drop out.<br />
Start up. For I can tell you that a cap and gown will keep you down<br />
just as surely as these security guards dragging me off this stage are<br />
keeping me dow...&quot;<br />
        <br />
        (At this point The Oracle CEO was ushered off stage.)</font></font></div></p>
