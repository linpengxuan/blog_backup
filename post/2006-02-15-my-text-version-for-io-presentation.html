paper……. Till now 2:31 in the morning, and I havn’t finish the ppt yet. That<br />
made me start ponder myself, <span style="color:rgb(255,153,0);">what did I do before</span>?</span></p></div></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">IAEA, NPT, Safeguard Agreements And<br />
analysis to Iran<br />
issues.</span></p></p>

<p><p style="text-indent:63pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span> </span>----- Lin Pengxuan</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">According to a recent United Nations<br />
High-Level Panel identified five categories of threats that we face:</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">1.<span>    </span>Poverty,<br />
Infectious Disease, and Environmental Degradation; </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">2.<span>    </span>Armed<br />
Conflict - both within and among States; </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">3.<span>    </span>Organized<br />
Crime; </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">4.<span>    </span>Terrorism;<br />
and </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">5.<span>    </span>Weapons<br />
of Mass Destruction. </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">My group topic today is largely dealing<br />
with the 5th one. Weapons of Mass Destruction, or WMD.<span>  </span>The term WMD means different things to<br />
different people. The most widely used definition is that of nuclear,<br />
biological or chemical weapons. And one of the main jobs of IAEA is to prevent<br />
the circulation and spreading of such weapons in related with atomic energy.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Thanks to my group members' excellent<br />
performance, which left me almost nothing else to cover within the statute of<br />
IAEA, I would like to talk about the current issues of IAEA. What are happening<br />
now? That is the interactivity among Iran, IAEA and International<br />
Community. My first part includes Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, Safeguard<br />
Agreements and their relations with IAEA, which is essential in understanding<br />
the following part, the Iran Nuclear Incident, where I will examine the legal<br />
basis of their dispute about the so-called right of peaceful use of nuclear<br />
power. Then it is followed by the third part, future development in perspective<br />
of reforming.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">what so many coutries want to rush into<br />
Nuclear Clubs?</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">The true meaning about holding nuclear<br />
weapons is not to use it, it is only been done once, but to show one state's<br />
ability in retaliating to the attacking country which uses nuclear weapons, in<br />
other sense, it is by possessing such weapons, assume a nuclear deterrence,<br />
thus gaining more chips playing in International Community. A country that<br />
thinks it can withstand a nuclear war is more likely to start one. Better to<br />
show your enemy you can hit back after a strike, than to show him you can<br />
survive one. Let me give you two examples, I can't recall any Indian now, but<br />
because they have such weapons, their voice in International Community is much<br />
louder than Japan, and several very important post were help by Indian, despite<br />
they have a large number of poor people who starve and strive. Also, recently,<br />
In January 2006, Jacques Chirac of France<br />
indicated that an incident of state-sponsored terrorism on France could trigger<br />
a small-scale nuclear retaliation aimed at destroying the &quot;rogue<br />
state's&quot; power centers. I don't think this would happen, but by saying<br />
such words, by posing such threatens, those rogue states have to take a second<br />
thought before they make the move. Such words are typical nuclear deterrence.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">on NPT, Safeguard Agreements.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Why these two?</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">As we have been observed before, one of the<br />
main functions for IAEA is to establish and apply safeguards to ensure that any<br />
nuclear assistance or supplies with which the IAEA was associated should not be<br />
used to further any military purposes. This confirms with the objectives of the<br />
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT<br />
or, much more rarely, NNPT) is a treaty, opened for signature on July 1, 1968,<br />
restricting the possession of nuclear weapons. By ensuring 3 pillars it<br />
focuses, the initiate states to the treaty hope it can dramatically reduce the<br />
risk of using Nuclear Weapons. </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">First pillar:Non-proliferation</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Five states are permitted by the NPT to own<br />
nuclear weapons: France (signed 1992), the People's Republic of China (1992),<br />
Soviet Union (1968; obligations and rights assumed by Russia), United<br />
 Kingdom (1968), and the United States (1968). These were<br />
the only states possessing such weapons at the time the treaty was opened to<br />
signature, and are also the five permanent members of the United Nations<br />
Security Council. These 5 Nuclear Weapons States (NWS) agree not to transfer<br />
nuclear weapons technology to other states, and the non-NWS state parties agree<br />
not to seek to develop nuclear weapons. According to what happened recently, I<br />
see no signs of such commitment binding either those states have nuclear<br />
weapons or those don't.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Second pillar: disarmament</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Article VI and the preamble indicate that<br />
the NWS parties pursue to reduce and liquidate their stockpiles; Article VI<br />
also calls for &quot;...a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under<br />
strict and effective international control.&quot; I believe this international<br />
control refer to the topic we discuss today, IAEA. In Article I, the Nuclear<br />
Weapon States declare not to &quot;induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to ...<br />
acquire nuclear weapons.&quot; </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Third pillar: the right to peacefully use<br />
nuclear technology</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">This one is most controversial. In scientific<br />
terms, it is feasible that one state could peacefully use nuclear technology<br />
without taking a further step, but when it comes into reality, states are<br />
induced by the power of possessing nuclear weapon when all the efforts only are<br />
needed a little bit more. However, thinking this is one thing while doing it<br />
could be another.<span>  </span></span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Since very few of the nuclear weapons<br />
states and states using nuclear reactions for energy generation are willing to<br />
completely abandon possession of nuclear fuel, the third pillar of the NPT<br />
provides other states with the possibility to do the same, but under conditions<br />
intended to make it difficult to develop nuclear weapons.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">For some states, this third pillar of the<br />
NPT, which allows uranium enrichment for fuel reasons, seems to be a major<br />
loophole. However the treaty gives every state the inalienable right to use<br />
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and as the commercially popular light<br />
water reactor nuclear power station designs use enriched uranium fuel, it<br />
follows that states must be allowed to enrich uranium or purchase it on an<br />
international market. Peaceful uranium enrichment can arguably be considered a<br />
small step away from developing nuclear warheads, and this can be done by<br />
withdrawing from the NPT. But, in fact, No state has successfully constructed a<br />
nuclear weapon in secret while subjected to NPT inspection. Some would argue Pakistan and<br />
Indian have nukes; the true is they are not the members to NPT. </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Countries that have signed the treaty as<br />
Non-Nuclear Weapons States and maintained that status have an unbroken record<br />
of not building nuclear weapons. In some regions, the fact that all neighbors<br />
are verifiably free of nuclear weapons reduces any pressure individual states<br />
might feel to build those weapons themselves, even if neighbors are known to<br />
have peaceful nuclear energy programs that might otherwise be suspicious. In<br />
this, the treaty works as designed.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">The relation between NPT and IAEA</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">The IAEA is not a party to the Treaty but<br />
is entrusted with key roles and responsibilities under it. Under the NPT, the<br />
IAEA has specific roles as the international safeguards inspectorate and as a<br />
multilateral channel for transferring peaceful applications of nuclear<br />
technology: according to the following article, IAEA is entitled to ensure<br />
prevention to the spread of nuclear weapons. And this laid the legal foundation<br />
for IAEA’s activities.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">NPT Article III: The IAEA administers<br />
international safeguards to verify that non-nuclear weapon States party to the<br />
NPT fulfill the non-proliferation commitment they have made, &quot;with a view<br />
to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons<br />
or other nuclear explosive devices.&quot;</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">NPT Article IV: The Agency facilitates and<br />
provides a channel for endeavors aimed at &quot;the further development of the<br />
applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in the<br />
territories of non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty, with due<br />
consideration for the needs of the developing areas of the world.&quot;</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">In practical terms, the IAEA also is seen<br />
as having roles in connection with verification of nuclear-weapon-free zones<br />
and in the context of verifying ex-nuclear weapon material.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">IAEA Safeguards Agreements </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Safeguards are activities by which the IAEA<br />
can verify that a State is living up to its international commitments not to<br />
use nuclear programmes for nuclear-weapons purposes. The global Nuclear<br />
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and other treaties against the spread of nuclear<br />
weapons entrust the IAEA as the nuclear inspectorate. Today, the IAEA<br />
safeguards nuclear material and activities under agreements with more than 140<br />
States.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Within the world’s nuclear<br />
non-proliferation regime, the IAEA is safeguards system functions as a<br />
confidence-building measure, an early warning mechanism, and the trigger that<br />
sets in motion other responses by the international community if and when the<br />
need arises.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Article III.A.5To establish and administer<br />
safeguards designed to ensure that special fissionable and other materials,<br />
services, equipment, facilities, and information made available by the Agency<br />
or at its request or under its supervision or control are not used in such a<br />
way as to further any military purpose; and to apply safeguards, at the request<br />
of the parties, to any bilateral or multilateral arrangement, or at the request<br />
of a State, to any of that State's activities in the field of atomic energy.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Fundamentally, by combining these two<br />
measures together, so far, IAEA do does a really good job in preventing the<br />
nuclear expansion while not hinder the development of civil use such huge<br />
power. That is so far. Also this is the reason the General Director of IAEA won<br />
the laurel of Nobel Peace Prize.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Then…</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">The timeline of Iran event.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">August 14, 2002</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Sources revealed the existence of two<br />
secret nuclear sites, a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz and a heavy water<br />
facility in Arak.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Later</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">The U.S.<br />
has since late 2003 claimed that Tehran is<br />
seeking to build nuclear arms in violation of its agreements under the NPT, and<br />
also that Iran<br />
is seeking to develop nuclear missiles.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">November 14, 2004 </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Iran</span><span lang="EN-US">'s chief nuclear negotiator announced a voluntary and temporary<br />
suspension of its uranium enrichment program after pressure from the United Kingdom, France,<br />
and Germany<br />
acting on behalf of the European Union (known in this context as the EU-3 or<br />
EU3). </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">November 24, 2004</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Iran</span><span lang="EN-US">
sought to amend the terms of its agreement with the EU to exclude a handful of<br />
the equipment from this deal for research work. This request was dropped four<br />
days later.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">January, 2005</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">IAEA Secretary General Mohamed ElBaradei<br />
remarked that after three years of inspections, the IAEA could not confirm that<br />
Iran's<br />
nuclear technology program is for peaceful purposes.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">August 8 and August 10, 2005 </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Iranian officials said they had lost much<br />
of their confidence in the IAEA, the Iranian government resumed its conversion<br />
of uranium at the Isfahan<br />
facility, allegedly with continued suspension of enrichment activities.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">September 19, 2005</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">the European Union pressuring the<br />
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to bring Iran's nuclear program<br />
before the United Nations Security Council.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">February 4, 2006</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">The 35 member Board of Governors of the<br />
IAEA voted 27-3 to report Iran<br />
to the Security Council. Such action’s legal basis comes from ARTICLE XII: C,<br />
In the event of failure of the recipient State or States to take fully<br />
corrective action within a reasonable time, the Board may take one or both of<br />
the following measures: direct curtailment or suspension of assistance being<br />
provided by the Agency or by a member, and call for the return of materials and<br />
equipment made available to the recipient member or group of members. The<br />
Agency may also, in accordance with article XIX, suspend any non- complying<br />
member from the exercise of the privileges and rights of membership.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Then the result would be up to the Security<br />
Council's decision. According to UN Charter, Article 26: In order to promote<br />
the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security with the<br />
least diversion for armaments of the world's human and economic resources, the<br />
Security Council shall be responsible for formulating, with the assistance of<br />
the Military Staff Committee referred to in Article 47, plans to be submitted<br />
to the Members of the United Nations for the establishment of a system for the<br />
regulation of armaments. </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Also, under Article 41 of the UN Charter,<br />
The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use of armed<br />
force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon<br />
the Members of the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include<br />
complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air,<br />
postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication, and the severance<br />
of diplomatic relations.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">the Security Council may call upon Member<br />
States to apply measures not involving the use of armed force in order to<br />
maintain or restore international peace and security. Such measures are<br />
commonly referred to as sanctions. </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Security Council's decision will probably<br />
come as sanction if Iran<br />
keep its way on, like treatment Iraq<br />
got after invading its neighbor Kuwait<br />
if it is regarded to solve this issue as necessary and urgent.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Or really does it necessary?</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">There are only two assumptions for Iran's own<br />
assertion.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">A to develop civil use of nuclear<br />
technology.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">B by disguise with this, Iran is enticed<br />
to develop its own weapon of mass destruction.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">A, the first one is preferable to second.<br />
Actually, apart from the other entire international Pressures either from US,<br />
EU or Russia, Iran does have<br />
a right in developing it for civil use. As I have said before, one of three<br />
pillar of the NPT is the right to peacefully use nuclear technology. Since Iran join the NPT in as early as 1968, there is<br />
no doubt Iran<br />
is entitled to develop it for civil use. The question raised here is it can<br />
develop nuclear technology to what extent and in what forms. Also, what we have<br />
observed here is that it has fail to comply with the safeguard agreement<br />
between IAEA, the directive result of which is Director General of IAEA will<br />
turn to UN security council.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Iran</span><span lang="EN-US">
claims that, </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">1. Iran claims that nuclear power is<br />
necessary for a booming population and rapidly industrializing nation. It<br />
points to the fact that Iran's<br />
population has more than doubled in 20 years.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">2. Iran questions why it shouldn't be<br />
allowed to diversify its sources of energy, especially when there are fears of<br />
its oil fields eventually being depleted. </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">3. It continues to argue that its valuable<br />
oil should be used for high value products, not simple electricity generation.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Those reasons, at least I think are sound.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">B. then let us assume Iran's real intention is to develop<br />
its own WMD. That would be a worst result of all. We better put out the flame<br />
before it becomes fire. The western society believe so because the following<br />
reasons,</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">1, it is better to have a tiger without<br />
teeth than a cat with untrimmed claw, even what Iran said is true, Western society<br />
just wants it to keep away from nuclear club. </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">2. A war break out between Iran and Israel. In Iran's constitution, they don't recognize the<br />
sovereignty right of Israel,<br />
and also, in various public instances, President of Iran asserted to wipe Israel out from<br />
the map. Since Israel's<br />
ability to develop the nukes has been proved for a long time, it is not<br />
difficult to guess Iran<br />
has to develop its own for counter-nuclear deterrence.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">3. Probably it would result in an US' invasion into Iran, at least by air force to take<br />
out the nuclear research invasion. Think about what Mr. George Bush did to Iraq when there<br />
were no evidence at all of the WMD found aftermath. It is not hard to take a<br />
second guess on Iran issue,<br />
at least, according to some recently news, there were voice about bombing<br />
nuclear facilities in Iran<br />
from Pentagon. </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">4. A new round of arm race will begin in<br />
Middle East, which would darken the already hazed peace perspective in Middle East.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">5. Raise the already skyrocketed oil price<br />
thus burdening the world economy. The situation has to take into account is<br />
that Iran, is the world's fourth biggest oil exporter, among the amount of Oil<br />
imports from Iran by EU, 33% comes from Iran. Either sanction or invasion would<br />
no doubt result in a much higher oil price thus render a unidentified and<br />
unstable factor to world economy.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">The options of Iran</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">After I have done a lot of googling, I see<br />
no signs or reasons that Iran<br />
will give up its own nuclear project. So far, to keep on its own plan, it might<br />
withdraw from NPT. </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">According to NPT, ARTICLE X Each Party<br />
shall in exercising its national sovereignty have the right to withdraw from<br />
the Treaty if it decides that extraordinary events, related to the subject<br />
matter of this Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country. </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">Sum Up</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">We are not sure, by playing this dangerous<br />
game, what is real intention of Iran,<br />
either for peaceful use, or gaining political windfall, or even the power of<br />
nuclear deterrence. So far, what I did before is just part of whole events.<br />
Part of my personal views and might not be true.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US">To conclude my presentation, I would quota<br />
words from Director General of IAEA, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, to feed world’s<br />
hunger, we only need 1% amount of money that is invested in arm race every<br />
year.</span></p></p>

<p><p><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p></p>
