<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!380" class="bvMsg">A Humble Heart<br />
By A. Oakley<br />
Stirring in her soul, is this child's silent desire.<br />
She prays with a humble heart, setting her soul on fire.<br />
Turning to God with her eyes fixed on heaven,<br />
She begins her talk with God, though she's only seven.<br />
You see her kneeling there<br />
With her head bowed down in prayer.<br />
She asks God for forgiveness of sins<br />
And that He would protect her, and all of her kin.<br />
She prays for the pony that she always has dreamed of<br />
Then praised God for sending His love.<br />
As she finishes, she thanks God for another day.<br />
Only if those older would pray this way;<br />
With a clear mind and a humble heart<br />
Praise God that your soul from Him can never depart.</div></p>
