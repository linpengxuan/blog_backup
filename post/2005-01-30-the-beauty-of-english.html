<p>Dear Dying Lin,</p>

<p>Hehe, your photos, eh, are terribly not beautiful at all!!!  I am scared! I know why you sent them to me,only for this might I reply, don't you think so?  I will definitly complain according to my often, urgent desire in beauty.</p>

<p>As to the pakage from Laomi, you and Qiulin can keep it. You and QIULIN, not only you! Don't be happy to cry. I know I am amazing, always! It is said that my being is a prepetual surprise, really not bad and vey honest saying, I like it!</p>

<p>Can't write in Chinese now. Sorry.</p>

<p>&quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, a wonderful movie, deserves taking your time.</p>
