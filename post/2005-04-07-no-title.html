<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!324" class="bvMsg">3月复习报告展望。<br />
真正的追求必是极度的苦郁<br />
这样不紧不慢，肯定是考不好的，这我是可以确定的。</div></p>

<p>想想还有多少时间，你觉得还能玩吗？</p>

<p>写出每天必须完成的任务和每月必须达到的目标。</p>

<p>即小目标和大目标。</p>

<p>在接下去的两周时间内，我将完成那本逻辑题集。  我将标出做错的题目。 这里我练的是速度。<br />
时间估计：那本书有7个部分，我以接近完成两个了。还有五个。一周2个半应该不是太难的事情。</p>

<p>剩下的两周时间内，我将把重点转移到逻辑game上。<br />
把那本书做完，标出错误</p>

<p>每周我要求完成至少一篇阅读。如果你是因为太讨厌重做阅读，而不做阅读的话，我建议你放弃这个想法。你不能因为不想做而不做，lsac又不是你开的。<br />
我有28篇阅读，我才做完7篇，还有21篇，如果每周两篇都可以。所以阅读也是无须担心没有材料。</p>

<p>每天我不管你有多忙，多紧张，我要求你至少完成一个game四组题和一个lr section。同时保证能够把这周的economist看完。</p>

<p>现在列出我每天要干的活：<br />
1，看lr书。<br />
2，做lr section和game四组题。<br />
3，每周要完成两篇阅读。<br />
4，周日末再组一份考卷。<br />
5，每天看economist只能限定两个小时。<br />
6，学业估计可能要退居次位了。</p>

<p>本月重在练习速度。但是要建立完善的复习体系，记下你做错的每道题目。综合起来后，每周拿出一个下午攻坚。可喜的是lr已经初见成效，具体表现在如下方面：<br />
猜题准确率提高。<br />
阅读速度提高。<br />
时间控制不错。<br />
整天表现不错。维持在6－8个之间，但是我的目标是4个之内。所以要求是熟悉的题目尽量全对，不熟的题目要抓紧攻坚。</p>

<p>Game的弱点还是在时间和无从下手上，我能作出的唯一建议，还是多看看cracking the lsat</p>

<p>牛人都这样了，你还有其他的理由不做吗。<br />
I studied 2-4 hours most days. I skipped a few days, when I was feeling burned out or too busy to concentrate. Studying entailed reviewing my mistakes multiple times after taking a practice LSAT, as well as reviewing the questions that I answered correctly. Studying also included practicing numerous games questions and some logic questions.</p>

<p>I had time to check my answers at the end of each section, so marking up the test would quickly pinpoint those questions needing review. My icon system of question marks/exclamation marks/boxes also let me to determine the order of importance during that double-checking review time. Best of all, marking up the practice test allowed me to study troublesome material again once I knew the correct answer.</p>

<p>The truth is that the game isn't impossible. No game is “impossible”. I simply needed to take a deep breath and realize, rationally, that I must have misunderstood something. Rules can't be contradictory and only one answer is correct. Thus, I must have assumed too much or misinterpreted something somewhere. I would carefully reread the prompt and the question. I would then analyze each component that made up the statement. Invariably, I found that I was skipping over a dependent clause or misreading a &quot;can&quot; as a &quot;cannot&quot;. It's usually something very minor, but important.</p>

<p>I wanted to know what made the passage was difficult. Was it terminology? Was I allowing myself to be intimidated by the material? Was it a matter of not enough focus during the test? After dissecting the passage a half-dozen times (aloud, silently, to a friend, whatever), I would feel as though I had &quot;conquered&quot; it, so to speak...it helped my confidence level immensely.</p>

<p>My big breakthrough was admitting that I had to stop reading the logic questions with my own agenda--I needed to focus on what patterns the *test-makers* saw and what conclusions the *test-makers* wanted. After I acknowledged that it was about jumping through the hoops rather than defending my personal opinions, it became almost fun. I liked &quot;switching&quot; my brain from regular thinking to LSAT-test-taker thinking. </p>

<p>For me, doing a few tests was enough to have intuition about what each RC passage’s questions would be</p>

<p>didn’t indicate that I was regressing --a low score just meant I had to be more careful with each question.</p>
