<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!628" class="bvMsg"><p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">I<br />
always am a person of gratitude that I was born in a country without<br />
Fire, yet not an indifferent person. Sometimes I came cross some<br />
headlines saying another human-body bomb in Iraq, or the death- toll<br />
of dead American now raises to a record-high,  the sadness would get<br />
out from the deep memory. Let us leave all those politics and games<br />
alone, just focus on the unrecoverable events. Don't know if those in<br />
west wings get the idea, but I want to strike it again, like the<br />
brave mother does in Bush's texas ranch, do u have any idea about the<br />
ones dying for your own political interests. In a time of so-called<br />
terrorism, misunderstanding is the last thing you ever need. Don't<br />
you forget all man are created equally, and they have the right to be<br />
left alone, don't you dare forget the lines in your national library,<br />
or your own history, if I am allowed to call that history, was also<br />
built in the name of freedom or liberty. Yes, you are right, you come<br />
to save them as God wants you, one and only one excuse you might use;<br />
or as any President of American would have done, no, you father did<br />
not, Mr Clinton did not. You are the deadliest terrorist on Earth,<br />
Mr. Bush.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Eh,<br />
Why not take a look at the pic. With the scarf, he is unidentified<br />
and an assasin, without it, he has to carry his own family, maybe<br />
there is a girl waiting to see him next morining, who might not make<br />
it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">I<br />
believe in equality, an equality beyond boundray, let alone the<br />
position, salary, anything. Also, human being just is an object in<br />
Nature, Universe. Either shining as star or living as a bug, you<br />
choose. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">I<br />
am not biased, for that after a long time, you are nothing but a<br />
rotting body in the earth.</font></p></div><table cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><a href="http://byfiles.storage.live.com/y1p3GWhxeMFjB4pDeQf_aqGNfLAWVBjLYY8zxGwMDOwI6COuB-gzoyaK6VUXTaCbo3WVng4RP2srzs" target="_blank" rel="WLPP;url=http://byfiles.storage.live.com/y1p3GWhxeMFjB4pDeQf_aqGNfLAWVBjLYY8zxGwMDOwI6COuB-gzoyaK6VUXTaCbo3WVng4RP2srzs;cnsid=cns&#033;3725CC0EE38B1F6&#033;629"><img src="http://byfiles.storage.live.com/y1p3GWhxeMFjB4pDeQf_aqGNfLAWVBjLYY8k-ZGqlXUkABzDZDrFTXR864_NrPHE-fo5g1PnmMFuUY" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></table></p>
