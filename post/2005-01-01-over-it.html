<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!129" class="bvMsg">Finally, I am over it.</div></p>

<p>With my striving yesterday, 3 parties in last day of 2004 come my new year 2005.</p>

<p>What more could I say. Nothing but Happy New Year and screaming to death. </p>

<p>We dance in a most conservative university in the world.</p>

<p>Secretly.</p>

<p>With the friends from Canada, Australia and U.S.</p>

<p>Also our drama receives great success among those kids.</p>

<p>Now, it doesnâ€™t matter how much time I spent in writing the drama and how much times I had to call all the actor persons together.</p>

<p>It is worthy.</p>

<p>At the last day of 2004, NIRVANA.</p>
