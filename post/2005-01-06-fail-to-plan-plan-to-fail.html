<p>It is a common sense that someone should improve his reading, speaking, writing and listening if he or she wants to improve his or her English. It is also these very things I always pay no seriously attention to. I am the person always shouting don’t know what to do, yet be left a lot to.</p>

<p>No longer will such awkwardness exist after today. I made a plan for me in this coming month.</p>

<p>1. listening. Two types for listening I think are needed to improve. The first one is the ability to news report. The other is about daily communication. Why? I always was puzzled I get no problem in understanding what CNN, BCC talk about, but still don’t know a thing in their daily life talking. I will make this difference disappear, I promise.</p>

<p>2, speaking. no clue yet. I am going to follow what those anchors, correspondents as much as possible.</p>

<p>3. reading. Read carefully on TIME archive for its beautiful words, complicated but reasonable and orthodoxy written English. Also, speed in reading will get practiced for reading NYtimes or Washington Post.</p>

<p>4, writing. Well. I am doing this right now, ain’t I? </p>

<p>5. Vocabulary. Squeeze some time for reciting them.</p>
