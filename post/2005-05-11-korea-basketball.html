<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!355" class="bvMsg">last time i play basketball in yongsei university in korea. what i<br />
learnt there is the way korea guys play.</div></p>

<p>1, they are very polite. you seldom see them disputing.  and they say<br />
thank u to each other  when finish one game.</p>

<p>2, they are more professional. maybe their individual ability could<br />
not match, but they play in teams. you got to love to play with them.</p>
