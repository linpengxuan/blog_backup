<p><p>
As a CEO, I get asked this a lot. And, I'm always a little embarrassed<br />
by it. For the most part, I get the question from people who are in<br />
their twenties. They want to know “the secret path to the top.”
</p><p>This past weekend, I received an email from one of my readers.<br />
He started, “I have an MBA, but I must have missed the course on<br />
Fast-Tracking My Career. If you had to boil it down to one thing, Mr.<br />
Hyatt, what would you recommend to a young, aspiring person such as<br />
myself?”
</p><p>I'm not sure I could boil it down to one thing. Life isn’t<br />
usually that simple. But if I really, really had to boil it down to one<br />
thing, I would say this: <em>responsiveness.</em>
</p><p>
So many people I meet are unresponsive. They don’t return their phone<br />
calls promptly. They don’t answer their emails quickly. They don’t<br />
complete their assignments on time. They promise to do something and<br />
never follow through. They have to be reminded, prodded, and nagged.<br />
This behavior creates work for everyone else and eats into their own<br />
productivity. Sadly, they seem oblivious to it.
</p></p>

<p><p>When I was a kid, we used to play “Tag.” The objective was simple:<br />
keep from becoming “It.” If someone tagged you (touched you), you<br />
became “it” until you tagged someone else. Whoever was “it” when the<br />
game ended, lost.
</p><p>Business is very similar. People “tag” us in countless ways<br />
every day. They place calls. They send emails. They mention something<br />
to us in a meeting. Suddenly, we are “it.” And, just like the game, if<br />
you stay “it” too long, you lose. The only winning strategy is to<br />
respond quickly and make someone else “it.”
</p><p>Reality is that we live in an “instant world.” People want<br />
instant results. They don’t want to wait. And if they have to wait on<br />
you, their frustration and resentment grows. They begin to see you as<br />
an <em>obstacle</em>
to getting their work done. If that happens, it will begin to impact<br />
your reputation. Pretty soon people start saying, “I can never get a<br />
timely response from him,” or “When I send her an email, I feel like it<br />
goes into a black hole,” or worse, your colleagues just roll their eyes<br />
and sigh at the mention of your name.
</p><p>Yet, these are the very people who will push you up or pull you<br />
down. You cannot succeed without the support of your peers and<br />
subordinates. (Go back and re-read that sentence again.)
</p><p>As I was making my way to the top, my former boss, Sam Moore,<br />
used to ask everyone I worked with, “What’s it like to work with Mike?”<br />
“How’s he really doing?” “Do you think he could take on more<br />
responsibility?” In responding to him, all they had was their<br />
experience with me. If I hadn’t been responsive to them, how do you<br />
think they would have responded to his questions? “More responsibility?<br />
Are you kidding me? He can’t handle what he has now!” It wouldn’t take<br />
too many candid responses like that to tank my career.
</p><p>And yet this happens to people all the time. I can’t tell you<br />
how many meetings I have sat in where people are complaining about<br />
someone else’s work habits. “He always waits until the last minute.”<br />
“She never plans ahead.” “I can never get him to respond to my emails.”<br />
You may think that the people who are making these comments are too far<br />
down the food chain to matter. I can assure you they aren’t. They have<br />
a way of bubbling to the top where the decisions about your career are<br />
made.
</p><p>
The truth is, you are building your reputation—your brand—<em>one response at a time.</em>
People are shaping their view of you by how you respond to them. If you<br />
are slow, they assume you are incompetent and over your head. If you<br />
respond quickly, they assume you are competent and on top of your work.<br />
Their perception, whether you realize it or not, will determine how<br />
fast your career advances and how high you go. You can’t afford to be<br />
unresponsive. It is a career-killer.
</p><p>My basic rule is this: respond immediately unless there is a<br />
good reason to wait. Obviously, this isn’t always possible, especially<br />
since I spend so much time in meetings. Nevertheless, I rarely let<br />
messages sit longer than a day. Twenty-four hours is the outside edge.<br />
If you can’t respond now, then at least acknowledge that you have<br />
received the message: “I received your message. I don’t have time to<br />
give it the attention it deserves right now, but you can expect to hear<br />
from me before the end of the day tomorrow.”
</p><p>The great thing about being responsive is that it will quickly<br />
differentiate you from your peers. People love doing business with<br />
responsive people. Nothing will advance your career faster than this.
