<p><div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!813" class="bvMsg"><p style="font-family:Lucida Handwriting,Cursive,Simsun;">running<br />
like a crazy dog!</p>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Handwriting,Cursive,Simsun;"><br />
</p>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Handwriting,Cursive,Simsun;">I<br />
am not a person boasting the ability of self-control or discipline.<br />
however, Jogging is an exceptional. when asked why now, why in cold<br />
winter days. I gave them fake answers, say, have some reasons to buy<br />
new clothes, on diet, keep myself fit, it is cool or it is cold (not<br />
even sounds reasonable). but in fact, I don't need reasons for<br />
jogging. it to me like food and water to human body, yes, I addict to<br />
it, incredibly. 
</p>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Handwriting,Cursive,Simsun;"><br />
</p>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Handwriting,Cursive,Simsun;">every<br />
two days, I have my regular clothes  changed into my set, my running<br />
set. then run, run, run, run like Forrest Gump, run like a crazy dog.<br />
I don't even need to know where to end, for the course itself make me<br />
feel high enough.</p>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Handwriting,Cursive,Simsun;"><br />
</p>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Handwriting,Cursive,Simsun;">And<br />
I know I can make it, with courage and efforts.
