<p><p>今天听了本小说《<font face="Times New Roman, serif">the<br />
confession of an EHM</font>》，里面对<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Muslim</font>的世界观有个说法。</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The<br />
Americans want to take control the whole world. And now it could not<br />
be a better time doing it for it is already pretty much close to that<br />
point. USSR may stand on its way, but will prove to be<br />
destructive.(it was been proved in 1990) the competition in the<br />
future would not between the communism and capitalism but a war of<br />
faith, a war between Muslim and Christian. History has proved this<br />
several times. Ideology couldn't do anything, take a look at USSR, it<br />
has no substance, no economy, no faith, it was set up to doom. There<br />
are no other things in the world more faithful than Muslim world. So<br />
right now we wait, till we grow stronger, then we fight like a<br />
snake......</font></p>
<p><br />

<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">oops.</font>听到这心里都有一阵异样的感觉，联系到最近的丹麦政治漫画。突然感觉拉登的做法不过是<font face="Times New Roman, serif">Muslim</font>世界里的一种极端，但是却体现了这种思想的一种行为。</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">EHM</font>，<font face="Times New Roman, serif">economy<br />
hit man. Usually disguise as employee of multinational corporation<br />
been deployed over the world after world war II when arms conflict<br />
prove to be not a good solution in resolving dispute related to<br />
resource in cold war times. When they failed their mission, and their<br />
successor fail either, say, jack man, war would be the final but only<br />
solution. The first and second gulf war, the 1967 war between Israel<br />
and Egypt....</font></p>

is another excerpt by Bill Clinton who cited from Mr. Churchill.<br />
American would always find the best way to solve the problem only<br />
after it exhaustive all the other alternatives.</font></p><p><br /></p>and do we have to?<br /><br /><br /><img alt="The image “http://survivalcenter.com/images/EconHitMan.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." src="http://survivalcenter.com/images/EconHitMan.jpg" /><br /></p>
