People might wonder why all those radiculous but tiny small and impressive goodies could all happen in a short time in a typical American White Community. Let alone for the sake of TV, I found it interesting for it presents to me the virtues and views about what American Middle Class think about the  world, it should be selfishlessness to urge and supervise other guys obey not only the community laws but moreover a serias standards of moralities, which root from its Americanism and Christianity; and vicious, somewhat depressed, even desperate when it comes to deal with its own good.<br><br>never thought about killing people is so fun a thing in desperate housewife, they even dubbed with a funny background music. remember how W. George tried to murder Dr. Goldfine in a bridge just for resentfulness about Dr's advice to Mrs Van De Kamp<br><img src="http://a.abc.com/primetime/desperate/images/bios//season02/bart2.jpg" alt="Roger Bart - George Williams" border="0" height="211" width="166"><img alt="http://www.wisteria-lane.net/Episodes/imagessaison1/ep_2.goldfine.jpg" src="http://www.wisteria-lane.net/Episodes/imagessaison1/ep_2.goldfine.jpg"><br><br>woman: why are all rich men jerks?<br>man: same reason all beautiful woman are bitches.<br><br><br>the woman is giving us her baby, Gaby, we kiss whatever needed to be kissing<br><br><br>PS: also I never think of someone who are popular just because of their own selfishness.<br><br><img alt="The image “http://images.tvnz.co.nz/tvnz_images/tv2/programmes/desperate_housewives/gabrielle_carlos_d.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." src="http://images.tvnz.co.nz/tvnz_images/tv2/programmes/desperate_housewives/gabrielle_carlos_d.jpg"><br><br>just give me a moment, I am asking god to kill me!<br><br>you...you committed an insurance fraud.?<br>eh..only in legal sense<br><br><img alt="http://nico.se/blog/wp-content/test_susan.jpg" src="http://nico.se/blog/wp-content/test_susan.jpg"><br><br><br>I hate you.  you know what, the opposite of hate is not love, is indifference, if you hate me, that means you still care about me, and we are still connected.<br><br>PS: the role of red hair beauty Mrs Bree Van De Kamp gives us all the pet peeves and annoyance an American family could ever enjoy. and believe me, my friend, the early dating experience of the teenager sons and daughters is only the last thing they need to worry about. look, How elegant one could be when even holding a gun!<br><br><img alt="http://www.theceleblife.com/thumb.php?f=out/images/1133552391_BreePinkDress.jpg&w=480" src="http://www.theceleblife.com/thumb.php?f=out/images/1133552391_BreePinkDress.jpg&w=480"><br><br>among all the charaters, Edie Britt and Lynette are my favourite. Edie is smart, knows what she need and stick to her own principles, reminds me someone I knew. Lynette is smarter, knows how to get what she wants without bothering other by introducing some tactics, which also adds more fun parts to DH.<br><img alt="http://www.wisteria.tv/imgs/nic1.jpg" src="http://www.wisteria.tv/imgs/nic1.jpg"><br><br><img alt="http://z.about.com/d/primetimetv/1/0/s/D/Felicity_Huffman.jpg" src="http://z.about.com/d/primetimetv/1/0/s/D/Felicity_Huffman.jpg"><br>
