<div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!1102" class="bvMsg">I was trying to show some cool music of price of egypt to Dung, and I told him I got that movie, do you like to watch it.<br>and he said yes, oh you still have that, after I have finished my dissertation.<br><br>woa. come on, he is never going to finish his dissertation.......<br><br>我想说我同意大家的看法。不知到还有什么时候，能够让我还能在这样的校园中开怀大笑，我一定很怀念这里的感觉，不为其他，只为那些关心我的兄弟姐妹们。只剩38天了，还是很珍惜的。因为以后大家上了战场，就连见面的机会也不会有的，甚至一辈子也不会再见了。<br>
