<div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!206" class="bvMsg">Suddenly, I found myself totally in a place. A place I have never been before. The strangeness start to cover me. My toe, my foot, my leg, then is the waist, chest, till my head completely fell into the shadow. I can feel nothing but fear.

What can I do? When the feeling ebbs off, it is weird that I have my eyes that can’t see, my mouth can’t shout, my nose can’t smell, my finger can’t touch, my tongue can’t taste. All the 5 basic feelings are deprived from me by someone I don’t care, without leaving any clue. It seems that I just was born in that way.

Then a light in the tunnel shines all over the dark space, I sensed it. And cramped footsteps were sensed. Everything in the flow of time seems to be normal but me……..


Forget about this dream.</div>
