<div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!276" class="bvMsg">I don’t have enough time, I gonna to make it short.

It is the anniversaries of the Last Supper. I went to church again.

Jesus said: if I, therefore, the master and teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash one another’s feet. I have given you a model to follow, so that as I have done for you, you should also do.

I am the one, whose feet are washed by the Italian father. 

Luck should not be a word using here to describe my feeling, more over, a moral burden I wish to take is bestowed, obligating me engage more in this sacred communities, though I still not really and fully understand and believe in the faith.

Forgive me, father, isn’t it the virtue you want us to follow, be faithful and truthful.



i feel guity everyday. for let the river of time floating away from me.</div>
