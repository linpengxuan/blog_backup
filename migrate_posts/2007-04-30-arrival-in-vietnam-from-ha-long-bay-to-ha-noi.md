<div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!1661" class="bvMsg">
<div>Finanlly, without knowing a word of Vietnamese, I came through the port, reached the soil of Vietnam. some ppl can speak Chinese...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I took a bus to Ha Long Bay, no one speaks Chinese there. i have to show them the destination I want to go. all the 4 hrs, i sat and put, without doing anything, only to find the driver is way too much brave to have a speed more than 70 km per hr in a rainy day...shit.. i have bought myself the insurance, comforting myself. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>then i met with my dear Senior Phong, the first thing is to hug him. no words could descripe that feeling after a 1000 km travle in 14 hrs. and his wife, my classmate Quynh.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>will say more when i could type Chinese....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>a word. after meeting them, i never felt i was in a foreign country, just felt like home. i am home now, with my bros and sisters.....<br><br>-- <br>Sincerely,<br><br>Lin Pengxuan </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>i am now on my trip to Nha Trang, a town has nothing but only blue sky and beautiful beaches, where I will learn how to dive and kiss the coral reef....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>met a lot of new friends, nice talk and begin to fall in love with taking pictures, will host a pix show later when i return to China, for that, i guess will take longer time, because i still have two countries to visit, combodia and Laos....haha</div>
