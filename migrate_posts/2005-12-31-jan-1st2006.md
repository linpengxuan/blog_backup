<div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!723" class="bvMsg">tomorrow it would be Jan 1st. again. shit. since when I lost my feeling about the coming new year, I don't know. or too many jan 1sts have diluted me in an era of rest.<br>anyway, I should be happy. I didn't die, I guess this could be one of not-too-many things I might celebrate. you don't know how dangerous it could be when I run on the icy roads, hoping those cars not going to hit me half dead or full. either way poses a common on my way.<br>movies say how a man treat his own car shows how a man treat himself. I agree. in this cold, dark winter days, I am going to give me something special! <br>
