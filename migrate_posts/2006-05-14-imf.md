<div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!1095" class="bvMsg">Well, this was straight to the point. Finally Hollywood seems to be
over their boring (hoping for Oscar) drama movies. Good old Cruise
returning as Ethan Hunt is what you will see here. Action consisting of
explosions, clever bombs, helicopter chases, flashbacks to True Lies
without spoiling too much, evil villains, heartbreaking stunts and a
pretty okay script is what you can expect.<br><br>Some predictable scenes, but the fast paced action made the effort
worth it with some very welcome ideas. You also got to love the
scenery. Berlin, Vatikan and China is refreshing to see.<br><br>007 look out, hard to match this one! <br><br>Long time since I had such fun at the cinema.<br><br><br><img alt="The image “http://www.c7nema.net/fotos/mi31.jpg” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors." src="http://www.c7nema.net/fotos/mi31.jpg"><br>
