<div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!1108" class="bvMsg">最近更新很少，是因为写得东西少。没东西上传了，就把刚写的DISSERTATION ACKNOWLEDGEMENT放上吧。<br><br><span lang="EN-US">One of the greatest things I learned from TLBU
in the past 2 years is knowing how to be grateful for everything I used to take
granted for. Indeed, from this prospective, the first person I truly and
sincerely respect and express my gratitude to is my President, Dr. LYOU Byunghwa,
for he not only shows me the vastness of his International legal expertise and
knowledge, guiding me into the right track on academic performance, moreover, the
love bestowed on me with a vision as a successful elder.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">Also, I wouldn’t forget all the other
faculty members in TLBU, Prof. John Lee, Prof. Choe, Prof. Kim, Prof. Thomas,
and Prof. Hong, I wouldn’t be lead into this legal majestic hall were not for
the help from all of them. Thanks.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">I also am glad to meet a lot more friends here,
thanks to you guys for bringing me laughters and sharing things with me. The end
of June, 2006 marks the time we departed from each other, also starts an era of
lifetime friendships among us.</span>

<span lang="EN-US">Last but not the least, thanks to my
beloved parents, for everything you have done to me, and for spoiling me all
the time, for adopting my little sister.</span>
