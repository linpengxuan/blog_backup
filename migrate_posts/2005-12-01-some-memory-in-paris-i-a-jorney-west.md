<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">It
was already 26 hrs since we left Seoul last time.  A journey of
virgin, I suppose this trip would be. And certainly it was. The first
stop is Hong Kong. My dream place, which I have thought about
visiting couple times. Time is limited, even me I don't have enough
time to set up my wireless network in the airport.</span></font></font></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">My
Hong Kong Stop</span></font></font></font>
<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2">It
is only the modernized constructions and the Cantonese-English mixing
speaking environment make me realize this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> last
land China reclaimed from its colonies, and which still keeps its own
distances from the owner. Everything was not quite strange to me,  
for I know this is typical airport, only with a knowledge that this
airport seems to be rated as the most human friendly airport over the
earth, apart from this, I know nothing about here as I do to Hong
Kong, not to mention the newly open Disneyland. What amazed, which I
should not used is the Internet from wireless network is free. I
regretted my short staying there, for I got chance to stay so close
with the eastern pearl but with a not-enough time. Packing all my
stuff along with unbagged slippers is the things I finished in 15
seconds for I was informed to get on board.</font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">My
first touch and leaving off the Hong Kong.</span></font></font></font>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Flight,CX
261.</span></font></font></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">I
hate to admit I am a person of missy, but indeed I am. You will know
by telling from the diaries I made.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">1,
I enjoyed a business class with an economic ticket. It was a little
things you can embrace only with some braveness and losing face. I
sat on the first row of my cartage. For I know I can't stuck on this
small room for 12 hrs. come on, that disastrous memory I took in my
first bachlor year backing home reminded me again. Cool, and I did
it, took a seat which by then not been taken yet. With no luck, I had
to surrender it later when the seat holder came to me. Damn it, I
told myself in my heart. Then I moved to another seat in the first
row.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">2,
time-killing. First, I made a question to a fly attendant, who I
thought was beautiful and mature about the electric plug. Her
positive answer surprised me for I didn't really expect to hear a
yes. Not until I found the plug needed a transfer did it make me sad.
Damn it, again. She told me I could buy a tax-free transfer plug. I
made my own move, good, why not, then I could play with my computer
all the time from then on with a psychiatric price of 10 dollar. I
knew I was gonna say damn it again, for it was priced 116 dollar.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Please,
lend me one.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Ok,
I will ask someone if he agreed. This attendant from Cathay Airline
indeed did not fail me.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">We
charge you 5 dollars an hour.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Damn
it, tell me that was a joke. I was almost come out with this sentence
were he not someone strange to me. And he is making a joke and I felt
shamed for not catching that.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">3,
she is nice. For whatever reason I don't want to believe, say, that
is her job, she was trained to do this. Rather I would like to
believe that was just because of me. Like the good old days when I
was in ECUPL, I chose to believe all the girls' apple in their eyes
is me, ridiculous but felt good.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">She
is beautiful.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">She
is mature enough,*******************(del 6 words here), I suppose.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">I
did not thank her directly for I got no chance. I will pray for her.
May god bless her and beautify her more.</span></font></font></font>

<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Paris</span></font></font></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">tiredness
is not the first thing we felt after a 12 hr long journey in a plane
full of non-stopping and quite disturbing noise. It was all just
because it was Paris. Don't mention the Taxi are from Mercedes Benz
or Volkswagen. I am a self-lover that could even love me more by
receiving a smile from the custom lady.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Eiffle
tower and other places as planned to visit did not really recall my
attention too much, rather it was those distinguish and unique style
of France streets and well-dress French or foreigners raise my
appetite to know this country more. I will write more about this
later.</span></font></font></font>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Our
institute locates in a place near Paris, not quite much known to
visitors but worthy traveling. I guess that is something we should
proud of, isn't it?</span></font></font></font>
<br>
<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="2"><span lang="en-US">Get
tired now, I am gonna to get rid off my jet leg.</span></font></font></font>
