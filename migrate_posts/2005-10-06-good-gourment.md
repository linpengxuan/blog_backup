<div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!436" class="bvMsg">i am now trying to tell a joke in English, might not be or of course it won't be funny, but it is true. 
it is not until the lunch time that I found myself began to be hungary, given that I already missed my breakfast due to oversleep. so I took a sit in Cafeteria, and I am so lucky that I can sit beside my beautiful roommate Dung, because I knew he would surely prepare some extra food. today is not an exception. the cuisine is overburnt fish. now the evil Dianna joined us, and started to taste a piece, saying , umm, good beef.
gosh , i know what she was thinking. by saying this , she can request one more chance to confirm this is not beef but fish.
