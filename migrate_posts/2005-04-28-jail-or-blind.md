<div id="msgcns!3725CC0EE38B1F6!336" class="bvMsg">I made a dream in which I lost my freedom, the most precious treasure one could have. Then I woke up with my fear left behind, sweating.

Again, I made a same dream, the difference is this time I lost my sight. This unprecedented and horrible accident nail me down deep into the wall, I still remember how I beg the pardon from the lord in the dream. Again, when I woke up, there is no more word could describe my happiness.

Thank u.</div>
