<tt> </tt><span><span>an email from Pumpkin. but my question is since when I lost my right to express my unconfortable feeling in front of any body, especailly some friends. and you don't even need to add a haha at the end of this letter for god's sake, it won't do it any good. my feeling is I have had enough this kind of talk, now that was something what really unconforts me.<br>btw，我早以在心中放下了这件事，你还一直提起，不知到底是谁的心里出了问题。<br><br>无欲则刚。<br></span></span>
